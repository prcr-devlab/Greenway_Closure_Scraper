      "> The City of Raleigh has closed the Crabtree CreekGreenway at mile marker 12 between the trail access at North Hills Drive and theMine Creek Trail and Crabtree Creek Greenway intersection. This map shows the location of the closed section of trail and thedetour on North Hills Drive. High levels of rain and stormwater runoffcaused excessive erosion and damage to the streambank supporting the retainingwall adjacent to Crabtree Creek and has made this section of the Crabtree CreekGreenway hazardous for public access. These photos are of the retaining wall in its failing condition. The detour will follow the southern side of North Hills Drive for a half-mile and connect to the Mine Creek Trail access. Trail users can continue north, across North Hills Drive to Shelly Lake Park, or south, along the Mine Creek Trail, to reconnect with the Crabtree Creek Trail at the “Z” Bridge, structure #37.

      "> During Hurricane Matthew the City of Raleighsustained damage due to flooding. The stream banks of Crabtree Creek east ofRaleigh Boulevard were eroded. The eroded banks must be stabilized to protectthe Crabtree Creek greenway trail from further erosion. This stablization project, located east of Raleigh Boulevard, is along the top of the right bank (lookingdownstream) of Crabtree Creek. The creek is wide with steep slopes. Bankerosion has led to the asphalt trail washing away in a number of locations inthe past and the trail has been numerously relocated. The trail is currentlyaffected in two locations: one near the new sewer crossing and the secondfurther downstream. This map shows the location of the conditions and project work described. The City is conducting an assessment of the existing conditions of stream and riparian areasalong Crabtree Creek to determine which areas need immediate attentionand to rank the remaining areas for risk of failure. This work will include assessing the feasibility of repairs and recommendationsas to the most realistic and necessary approach to protecting the trailthroughout the site. The Crabtree Creek Trail will remain open in this area throughout the course of this work. \n",
